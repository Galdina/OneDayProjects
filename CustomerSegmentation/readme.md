# Customer Segmentation 

Customer Segmentation is the process of splitting customers into multiple groups of individuals that share a similarity in ways a product is or can be marketed to them such as gender, age, interests, demographics, economic status, geography, behavioral patterns, spending habits and much more. Using customer segmentation, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base.

Customer Segmentation is unsupervised learning. 

Algorithms to be used:
* K-means clustering 
* Partitioning method
* Fuzzy clustering

* Model-based clustering

Customer Segmentation helps understanding of customer preferences and requirements for discovering valuable segments that would reap them maximum profit.
