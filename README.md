Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. Companies use the clustering process to foresee or map customer segments with similar behavior to identify and target potential user base.


Algorithms to be used for segmentation:
* K-means clustering 
* heirarchical clustering
* Partitioning method
* Fuzzy clustering
* Density-based clustering
* Model-based clustering
